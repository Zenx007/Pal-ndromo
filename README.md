# Palindrome Checker in C#

This is a simple C# console application that checks whether a word entered by the user is a **palindrome**.

A **palindrome** is a word that reads the same backward as forward. For example: `radar`, `level`, `madam`.

## ðŸ’» How It Works

- The user is prompted to enter a word.
- The input is converted to lowercase to ensure case-insensitive comparison.
- The program manually reverses the word.
- It compares the original and reversed versions to determine if it's a palindrome.
